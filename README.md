# Image-Classification
In this project, I build and train a deep L-layer neural network, and applied to classify cat images from non-cat images using python in jupyter notebook.

In this notebook, you'll implement all the functions required to build a deep neural network.
For the next assignment, you'll use these functions to build a deep neural network for image classification.
By the end of this assignment, you'll be able to:

Use non-linear units like ReLU to improve your model
Build a deeper neural network (with more than 1 hidden layer)
Implement an easy-to-use neural network class
Notation:

Superscript  [𝑙]  denotes a quantity associated with the  𝑙𝑡ℎ  layer.
Example:  𝑎[𝐿]  is the  𝐿𝑡ℎ  layer activation.  𝑊[𝐿]  and  𝑏[𝐿]  are the  𝐿𝑡ℎ  layer parameters.
Superscript  (𝑖)  denotes a quantity associated with the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  example.
Example:  𝑥(𝑖)  is the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  training example.
Lowerscript  𝑖  denotes the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  entry of a vector.
Example:  𝑎[𝑙]𝑖  denotes the  𝑖𝑡ℎ  entry of the  𝑙𝑡ℎ  layer's activations).
Let's get started!
